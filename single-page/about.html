                <p><b>What we do</b><br>We work with local people to understand the key issues which affect their lives and to ensure their voices are heard nationally and internationally. Our work is underpinned by our understanding of these issues and their importance in building lasting peace.</p>
                <p><b>How we work</b><br>Peace does not automatically follow when a peace agreement is signed. When the fighting ends, the real work begins. It takes a lot of people working together to build lasting peace. And it takes time â€“ sometimes decades. But we know it is possible.<br>We work to understand the underlying causes of conflict, so we can help communities handle their conflicts without resorting to violence.<br>To build peace we use the following methods:</p>
                <ul><li><a href="http://www.international-alert.org/resources/publications"><u>Research</u></a> - We research the causes of conflict around the world.</li>
                    <li>Dialogue - We bring people together to help them better understand their differences and resolve them peacefully.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.international-alert.org/training-and-learning"><u>Training</u></a> - We provide people with the skills they need to support and bring about peace.</li>
                    <li>Advocacy - We advise on international policies and practices that affect peace, and ensure that the voices and needs of local communities are heard nationally and internationally.</li>
                    <li>Accompaniment - We offer guidance and advice to people, organisations and companies as they build peace or operate in high-risk places.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To find out more about our methodology, <a href="http://www.international-alert.org/resources/publications/programming-framework">read our Programming Framework here</a>.</p>
                <p><b>Impact</b><br>International Alert aims to make a difference. In villages in Rwanda, eastern DRC and Peru, among divided communities in Kyrgyzstan, the South Caucasus and Myanmar, between politicians of different allegiances in Beirut, the Philippines and Uganda, our work does just that.<br>Our work is about the people in those communities, villages and groups. We help them to recover in the aftermath of armed conflict, strengthen institutions to provide protection against looming violence, and bring people together to find ways of resolving their differences peacefully.</p>
